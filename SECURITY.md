# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in SecretCheck itself, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email the details to: [arno+security@arnow.solutions](mailto:arno+security@arnow.solutions) (or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting)
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

We'll acknowledge your report within 48 hours and work on a fix as quickly as possible.

## Scope

This policy applies to vulnerabilities in the SecretCheck tool itself, not secrets found by the tool in your repositories.

## Supported Versions

We support the latest release with security updates. Older versions may not receive patches.

Thank you for helping keep SecretCheck secure!
